    <h1 style="line-height: 40px"> Enjoy atmospheric and delightfurl town </h1>
    <p>Graceful, historic Hoi An is Vietnam’s most atmospheric and delightful town. Once a major port, it boasts the
        grand architecture and beguiling riverside setting that befits its heritage, and the 21st-century curses of
        traffic and pollution are almost entirely absent.
        The face of the Old Town has preserved its incredible legacy of tottering Japanese merchant houses, Chinese temples
        and ancient tea warehouses – though, of course, residents and rice fields have been gradually replaced by tourist
        businesses.
